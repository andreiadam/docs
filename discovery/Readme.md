# Discovery

The Discovery service finds out which nodes are online and accessible on the
network in a real-time, distributed fashion.

The implementation for the service is hosted
[here](github.com/liquidinvestigations/discover).

See more about the technical implementation [here](TestingDiscovery.md).
