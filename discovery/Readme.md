# Discovery

The Liquid Discovery service provides a way for users to find other nodes on a
network, streamlining collaboration. This is particularly applicable in war
room scenarios, where multiple journalists may bring their indexed, searchable,
annotated data to a team environment.

The service identifies other nodes on a network and presents information about
them to the user. It operates in a real time and distributed manner, with no
central registry.

For technical details about the implementation see 
[this](DiscoveryImplementation.md). [Here](DiscoveryTestingStrategy.md) you
can find how the system is being tested.

The service implementation is hosted
[here](github.com/liquidinvestigations/discover).
